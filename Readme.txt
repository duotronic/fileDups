novice's java8 pc file utility using hibernate5 w/annotations
This utility allows me to find, report, eliminate files.
I collect media files (.mp3, .mp4, dvd and pictures) - my files are on ide, sata, cd, dvd and m-disc.
the program is used in 2 phases, collecting data, and reporting.
when collecting data; that computer does not need a database.
phase a - create a set's list of file names
phase b - for a set - collect file properties & it's crc in .csv file
phase c - copy set's data into database
phase d - reports

I gratefully thank those who have created tutorials, and stackoverflow.com contributors.
